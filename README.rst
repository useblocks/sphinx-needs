Introduction
============

``Sphinx-Needs`` allows the definition, linking and filtering of class-like need-objects, which are by default:

* requirements
* specifications
* implementations
* test cases.

This list can be easily customized via configuration (for instance to support bugs or user stories).

A default requirement need looks like:

   :align: center

Layout and style of needs can be highly customized, so that a need can also look like:

   :align: center

Take a look into our `Examples <https://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html>`_ for more
pictures and ideas how to use ``Sphinx-Needs``.

For filtering and analyzing needs, ``Sphinx-Needs`` provides different, powerful possibilities:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 46,14,40

   - * `needtable <https://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/directives/needtable.html>`_
     * `needflow <https://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/directives/needflow.html>`_
     * `needpie <https://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/directives/needpie.html>`_
