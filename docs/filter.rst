.. _filter:

Filtering needs
===============

**Sphinx-Needs** supports the filtering of need and need_parts by using easy to use options or powerful filter string.

Available options are specific to the used directive, whereas the filter string is supported by all directives and
roles, which provide filter capabilities.

.. _filter_options:

Filter options
--------------

The following filter options are supported by directives:

 * :ref:`needlist`
 * :ref:`needtable`
 * :ref:`needflow`
 * :ref:`needpie`
 * ``needfilter`` (deprecated!)
 * :ref:`needextend`


Related to the used directive and its representation, the filter options create a list of needs, which match the
filters for status, tags, types and filter.

For **:status:**, **:tags:** and **:types:** values are separated by "**;**".
**:filter:** gets evaluated.

The logic, if a need belongs to the final result list, is as followed::

    status = (open OR in_progress) AND tags = (user OR login) AND types = (req OR spec) AND eval(filter) is True


.. _option_status:

status
~~~~~~
Use the **status** option to filter needs by their status.

You can easily filter for multiple statuses by separating them by ";". Example: *open; in progress; reopen*.

.. dropdown:: Show example

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. needlist::
         :status: open
         :show_status:

   .. needlist::
         :status: open
         :show_status:

.. _option_tags:

tags
~~~~

**tags** allows to filter needs by one or multiple tags.

To search for multiple tags, simply separate them by using ";".

.. dropdown:: Show example

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. needlist::
         :tags: main_example
         :show_tags:

   .. needlist::
         :tags: main_example
         :show_tags:


.. _option_types:

types
~~~~~
For **:types:** the type itself or the human-readable type-title can be used as filter value.

.. dropdown:: Show example

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. needtable::
         :types: test

   .. needtable::
      :types: test
      :style: table


.. _option_sort_by:

sort_by
~~~~~~~
Sorts the result list. Allowed values are ``status`` or any alphanumerical property.

.. dropdown:: Show example

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. needtable::
         :sort_by: id
         :status: open


   .. needtable::
      :sort_by: id
      :status: open
      :style: table



.. _option_filter:

filter
~~~~~~

The filter option allows the definition of a complex query string, which gets evaluated via eval() in Python.
Please see :ref:`filter_string` for more details.

.. _filter_string:

Filter string
-------------

The usage of a filter string is supported/required by:

* :ref:`need_count`
* :ref:`needlist`
* :ref:`needtable`
* :ref:`needflow`
* :ref:`needpie`
* :ref:`needbar`


The filter string must be a valid Python expression:

.. code-block:: rst

   :need_count:`type=='spec' and status.upper()!='OPEN'`

A filter string gets evaluated on needs and need_parts!
A need_part inherits all options from its parent need, if the need_part has no own content for this option.
E.g. the need_part *title* is kept, but the *status* attribute is taken from its parent need.

.. note::

   Following attributes are kept inside a need_part: id, title, links_back

This allows to perform searches for need_parts, where search options are based on parent attributes.

The following filter will find all need_parts, which are part of a need, which has a tag called *important*.

.. code-block:: rst

   :need_count:`is_part and 'important' in tags`

Inside a filter string the following variables/functions can be used:

* **tags** as Python list (compare like ``"B" in tags``)
* **type** as Python string (compare like ``"story" == type``)
* **status** as Python string (compare like ``"opened" != status``)
* **sections** as Python list with the hierarchy of sections with lowest-level
  section first.  (compare like ``"Section Header" in sections``)
* **id** as Python string (compare like ``"MY_ID_" in id``)
* **title** as Python string (compare like ``len(title.split(" ")) > 5``)
* **links** as Python list (compare like ``"ID_123" not in links``)
* **links_back** as Python list (compare like ``"ID_123" not in links_back``)
* **content** as Python string (compare like ``len(content) == 0``)
* **is_need** as Python boolean. (compare like ``is_need``)
* **is_part** as Python boolean. (compare like ``is_part``)
* **parts** as Python list with :ref:`need_part` of the current need. (compare like ``len(parts)>0``)
* :ref:`re_search`, as Python function for performing searches with a regular expression
* **needs** as Python dict. Contains all needs. Helpful to perform complex filters on links (added 0.3.15).
* **sections** as list of sections names, th which the need belongs to.
* **section_name** as string, which defines the last/lowest section a need belongs to.
* **docname** as string, which defines the name of the document in which a need is defined, without the extension (similar to Sphinx' ``:doc:`` role)
* **signature** as string, which contains a function-name, possible set by
  `sphinx-autodoc <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_ above the need.
* **parent_need** as string, which is an id of the need, which has the current need defined in its content
  (added 0.6.2).
* **parent_needs** as string, which is a list of need ids (added 0.6.2).

Additional variables for :ref:`need_part`:

* **id_parent** as Python string, which contains the id of the parent need. (compare like ``id_parent == "ABC_01"``)
* **id_complete** as Python string. Contains the concatenated ids of parent need and need_part.
  (compare like ``id_complete != 'ABC_01.03'``)


.. note:: If extra options were specified using :ref:`needs_extra_options` then
          those will be available for use in filter expressions as well.

If your expression is valid and it's True, the related need is added to the filter result list.
If it is invalid or returns False, the related need is not taken into account for the current filter.

.. dropdown:: Show example

   .. code-block:: rst

       .. req:: Requirement A
          :tags: A; filter_example
          :status: open

       .. req:: Requirement B
          :tags: B; filter_example
          :status: closed

       .. spec:: Specification A
          :tags: A; filter_example
          :status: closed

       .. spec:: Specification B
          :tags: B; filter_example
          :status: open

       .. test:: Test 1
          :tags: filter_example

       .. needtable::
          :filter: "filter_example" in tags and ("B" in tags or ("spec" == type and "closed" == status)) or "test" == type

   This will have the following result:

   .. req:: Requirement A
      :tags: A; filter_example
      :status: open
      :hide:

   .. req:: Requirement B
      :tags: B; filter_example
      :status: closed
      :hide:

   .. spec:: Specification A
      :tags: A; filter_example
      :status: closed
      :hide:

   .. spec:: Specification B
      :tags: B; filter_example
      :status: open
      :hide:

   .. test:: Test 1
      :tags: filter_example
      :hide:

   .. needfilter::
      :filter: "filter_example" in tags and (("B" in tags or ("spec" == type and "closed" == status)) or "test" == type)

.. _re_search:

search
~~~~~~

search(pattern, variable) is based on
`Pythons re.search() function <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search>`_

The first parameter must be a regular expression pattern.
The second parameter should be one of the above variables(status, id, content, ..)

.. dropdown:: Show example

   This example uses a regular expressions to find all needs with an e-mail address in title.

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. req:: Set admin e-mail to admin@mycompany.com

      .. needlist::
         :filter: search("([a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)", title)

   .. req:: Set admin e-mail to admin@mycompany.com

   .. needlist::
      :filter: search("([a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)", title)

.. _export_id:

export_id
~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.3.11

If set, the filter results get exported to needs.json, if the builder :ref:`needs_builder` is used::

   .. needtable::
      :status: open
      :filter: "test" in tags
      :export_id: filter_01

See :ref:`filter_export` for more details.


.. _filter_code:

Filter code
-----------

.. versionadded:: 0.5.3

The content of a :ref:`needlist`, :ref:`needtable` or :ref:`needflow` can be used to define own filters
with the help of Python.

The used code must define a variable ``results``, which must be a list and contains the filtered needs.

.. code-block:: rst

   .. needtable::
      :columns: id, title, type, links, links_back
      :style: table

      # Collect all requirements and specs,
      # which are linked to each other.

      results = []
      # Lets create a needs_dict to address needs by ids more easily.
      needs_dict = {x['id']: x for x in needs}

      for need in needs:
         if need['type'] == 'req':
            for links_id in need['links']:
               if needs_dict[links_id]['type'] == 'spec':
                  results.append(need)
                  results.append(needs_dict[links_id])

.. needtable::
   :columns: id, title, type, links, links_back
   :style: table

   # Collect all requirements and specs,
   # which are linked to each other.

   results = []
   # Lets create a needs_dict to address needs by ids more easily.
   needs_dict = {x['id']: x for x in needs}

   for need in needs:
      if need['type'] == 'req':
         for links_id in need['links']:
            if needs_dict[links_id]['type'] == 'spec':
               results.append(need)
               results.append(needs_dict[links_id])

The code has access to a variable called ``needs``, which contains a copy of all needs.
So manipulations on the values in ``needs`` do not have any affects.

This mechanism can also be a good alternative for complex filter strings to save performance.
For example if a filter string is using list comprehensions to get access to linked needs.

If ``filter code`` is used, all other filter related options (like ``status`` or ``filters``) are ignored.

.. warning::

   This feature executes every given Python code.
   So be sure to trust the input/writers.


.. _filter_func:

Filter function
---------------

.. versionadded:: 0.7.3

Nearly same behavior as :ref:`filter_code`, but the code gets read from an external python file and a function must be
referenced.

:option name: filter-func
:default: None

Usage inside a rst file:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. needtable:: Filter function example
       :filter-func: filter_file.own_filter_code

The code of the referenced file ``filter_file.py`` with function ``own_filter_code``:

.. code-block:: python

   def own_filter_code(needs, results, **kwargs):
       for need in needs:
           if need["type"] == "test":
               results.append(need)

The function gets executed by **Sphinx-Needs** and it must provide two keyword arguments: ``needs`` and ``results``.

Also the given package/module must be importable by the used Python environment.
So it must be part of the Python Path variable. To update this, add
``sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("folder/to/filter_files"))`` to your **conf.py** file.

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.7.6

Filter function are supporting arguments: ``filter_file.own_filter_code(value_1,value_2)``.

Please note, that the part between ``(...)`` is just a comma separated list and each element will be given as string
to the function.

The functions get the values as part of ``**kwargs`` with the name is ``arg<pos>``, starting from ``1``.

Example:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. needtable:: Filter function example
       :filter-func: filter_file.own_filter_code(1,2.5,open)


.. code-block::

   def own_filter_code(needs, results, **kwargs):
       for need in needs:
           if int(need["price"]) > int(kwargs["arg1"]) or need["status"] == kwargs["arg3"]:
               results.append(need)

The function developer is responsible to perform any needed typecast.

Needpie
~~~~~~~
:ref:`needpie` also supports filter-code.
But instead of needs, a list of resulting numbers must be returned.

Example:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. needpie:: Filter code func pie
      :labels: new,done
      :filter-func: filter_code_func.my_pie_filter_code_args(new,done)


.. code-block:: python

   def my_pie_filter_code_args(needs, results, **kwargs):
       cnt_x = 0
       cnt_y = 0
       for need in needs:
           if need["status"] == kwargs['arg1']:
               cnt_x += 1
           if need["status"] == kwargs['arg2']:
               cnt_y += 1

      results.append(cnt_x)
      results.append(cnt_y)
