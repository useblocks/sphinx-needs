Requirements, Bugs, Test cases, ... inside Sphinx
=================================================

.. image:: _static/needs_logo_big.png

Sphinx-Needs allows the definition, linking and filtering of need-objects, which are by default:

* requirements
* specifications
* implementations
* test cases.

This list can be easily customized via :ref:`configuration <need_types>` (for instance to support bugs or user stories).

What is a need?
---------------

A need is a generic object, which can become everything you want for your sphinx documentation:
A requirement, a test case, a user story, a bug, an employee, a product or anything else.

But whatever you chose it shall be and how many of them you need, each need is handled the same way.

Each need contains:

* a **title** (required)
* an **unique id** (optional. Gets calculated based on title if not given)
* a **description**, which supports fully rst and sphinx extensions (optional)
* a **status** (optional)
* several **tags** (optional)
* several **links** to other needs (optional)
* project specific options (optional, see :ref:`needs_extra_options`)

Needs can be :ref:`easily filtered <filter>` and presented in lists, tables and diagrams.

For external synchronization (e.g. with JIRA, a spreadsheet, ...)
the builder :ref:`needs_builder` is available to export all created needs to a single json file.
And also importing needs from external files is supported by using :ref:`needimport`.

Example

Input
~~~~~

.. code-block:: rst

   **Some data**

   .. req:: My first requirement
      :id: req_001
      :tags: main_example

      This is an awesome requirement and it includes a nice title,
      a given id, a tag and this text as description.

   .. spec:: Spec for a requirement
      :links: req_001
      :status: done
      :tags: important; main_example
      :collpase: false

      We haven't set an **ID** here, so sphinx-needs
      will generated one for us.

      But we have **set a link** to our first requirement and
      also a *status* is given.

      We also have set **collapse** to false, so that all
      meta-data is shown directly under the title.

   **Some text**

   Wohooo, we have created :need:`req_001`,
   which is linked by :need_incoming:`req_001`.

   **Some filters**

   Simple list:

   .. needlist::
     :tags: main_example

   Simple table:

   .. needtable::
     :tags: main_example
     :style: table

   A more powerful table
   (based on `DataTables <https://datatables.net/>`_):

   .. needtable::
     :tags: main_example
     :style: datatables

Motivation
----------

This sphinx extension is based on the needs of a software development team inside
a german automotive company.

The project team was searching for a small and practical way of managing requirements and more to
fulfill the parameters of the `ISO 26262 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262>`_
standard for safety critical software.

Sphinx-Needs is part of a software bundle, which was designed to support the development of
`ISO 26262 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262>`_ compliant software.
Other tools are: `tox-envreport <http://tox-envreport.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

One more thing ...
------------------

The sphinx-needs logo was designed by `j4p4n <https://openclipart.org/detail/281179/engineers>`_.
