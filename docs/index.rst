Requirements, Bugs, Test cases, ... inside Sphinx
=================================================

.. image:: _static/needs_logo_big.png

Sphinx-Needs allows the definition, linking and filtering of need-objects, which are by default:

* requirements
* specifications
* implementations
* test cases.

This list can be easily customized via :ref:`configuration <needs_types>`.
For instance to support bugs, user stories or features.

Sphinx-Needs is an extension for the Python based documentation framework `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_,
which can be easily extended by different extensions to fulfill nearly any requirement of a software development team.

.. req:: What is a need
   :id: REQ_1
   :tags: introduction

   A need is a generic object, which can become everything you want for your sphinx documentation:
   A requirement, a test case, a user story, a bug, an employee, a product or anything else.

   But whatever you chose it shall be and how many of them you need, each need is handled the same way.

.. spec:: Content of each need
   :id: SPEC_1
   :tags: introduction, awesome, nice
   :status: open
   :links: REQ_1

   Each need contains:

   * a **title** (required)
   * an **unique id** (optional. Gets calculated based on title if not given)
   * a **description**, which supports fully rst and sphinx extensions (optional)
   * a **status** (optional)
   * several **tags** (optional)
   * several **links** to other needs (optional)
   * project specific options (optional, see :ref:`needs_extra_options`)
   * a **layout** (optional)
   * a **style** (optional)

.. feature:: Filtering needs
   :id: FEATURE_1
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   Needs can be :ref:`easily filtered <filter>` and presented in :ref:`lists<needlist>`, :ref:`tables <needtable>`,
   :ref:`diagrams <needflow>` and :ref:`pie charts <needpie>`.

**Table example**

.. needtable::
   :tags: introduction
   :style: table
   :columns: id, title, outgoing

**Diagram example**

.. needflow::
   :tags: introduction

.. feature:: Ex/Importing needs
   :id: FEATURE_2
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   For external synchronization (e.g. with JIRA, a spreadsheet, ...)
   the builder :ref:`needs_builder` is available to export all created needs to a single json file.
   And also importing needs from external files is supported by using :ref:`needimport`.

   .. code-block:: bash

      make html   # HTML output
      make needs  # needs.json containing all data

.. feature:: Connect to external services
   :id: FEATURE_3
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   ``Sphinx-Needs`` can request issues and other data from external services like :ref:`GitHub <github_service>`.

   Embed tickets, requirements and other external information from specific services
   into your documentation by using :ref:`services`.

.. feature:: Automated data handling
   :id: FEATURE_4
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   For complex data chains between needs, :ref:`dynamic_functions` can be used to load and set
   changeable data automatically during documentation generation phase.

.. feature:: Customizing everything
   :id: FEATURE_5
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1
   :layout: complete
   :style: yellow

   ``Sphinx-needs`` allows to customize needs-types, needs-options, colors, layouts, ids, checks, ... .

   The pages :ref:`config` and :ref:`layouts_styles` are full of possibilities to adopt ``Sphinx-needs`` for your
   own processes and workflows.

.. feature:: API for other extensions
   :id: FEATURE_6
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   The :ref:`api` allows other sphinx-extension to build specific solutions around and with ``Sphinx-Needs``.

   For instance `Sphinx-Test-Reports <https://sphinx-test-reports.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ creates needs from
   test results and makes them searchable and linkable to other need-types.

.. feature:: Developed for safe process executions
   :id: FEATURE_7
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   ``Sphinx-needs`` allows to define the exact allowed way of using and configuring needs.

   Use :ref:`needs_statuses`, :ref:`needs_tags` or :ref:`needs_warnings` to check for not allowed configurations,
   e.g. wrong status names.

   Or force the usage of exactly defined need-ids by setting :ref:`needs_id_required` and :ref:`needs_id_regex`.

   See :ref:`config` for more options to get a sphinx documentation valid with ISO 26262, DO-178B/C or any other
   safety standard.

Input
~~~~~

.. code-block:: rst

   **Some data**

   .. req:: My first requirement
      :id: req_001
      :tags: main_example

      This is an awesome requirement and it includes a nice title,
      a given id, a tag and this text as description.

   .. spec:: Spec for a requirement
      :links: req_001
      :status: done
      :tags: important; main_example
      :collapse: false

      We haven't set an **ID** here, so sphinx-needs
      will generated one for us.

      But we have **set a link** to our first requirement and
      also a *status* is given.

      We also have set **collapse** to false, so that all
      meta-data is shown directly under the title.

   **Some text**

   Wohooo, we have created :need:`req_001`,
   which is linked by :need_incoming:`req_001`.

   **Some filters**

   Simple list:

   .. needlist::
     :tags: main_example

   Simple table:

   .. needtable::
     :tags: main_example
     :style: table

   A more powerful table
   (based on `DataTables <https://datatables.net/>`_):

   .. needtable::
     :tags: main_example
     :style: datatables

Motivation
----------

This sphinx extension is based on the needs of a software development team inside
a german automotive company.

The project team was searching for a small and practical way of managing requirements and more to
fulfill the parameters of the `ISO 26262 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262>`_
standard for safety critical software in the Python environment.

Sphinx-Needs is part of a software bundle, which was designed to support the development of
`ISO 26262 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262>`_ compliant software.
Other tools are:
`sphinx-test-reports <https://sphinx-test-reports.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
`sphinx-collections <https://sphinx-collections.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and
`tox-envreport <http://tox-envreport.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

One more thing ...
------------------

The sphinx-needs logo was designed by `j4p4n <https://openclipart.org/detail/281179/engineers>`_.
