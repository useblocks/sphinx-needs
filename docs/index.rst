Requirements, Bugs, Test cases, ... inside Sphinx
=================================================

Sphinx-Needs is an extension for the `Python <https://python.org>`_ based documentation framework `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_,
which you can simply extend by different extensions to fulfill nearly any requirement of a software development team.

Sphinx-Needs allows the definition, linking and filtering of need-objects, which are by default:

* requirements
* specifications
* implementations
* test cases.

You can easily customize the list above via :ref:`configuration <needs_types>`.
For instance, you can customize the need objects to support bugs, user stories or features.

.. req:: What is a need
   :id: REQ_1
   :tags: introduction


   A **need** is a generic object which can become anything you want for your Sphinx documentation:
   a requirement, a test case, a user story, a bug, an employee, a product, or anything else.

   But regardless of whatever you choose it to be and how many of them you require, we handle each **need** object the same way.

.. spec:: Content of each need
   :id: SPEC_1
   :tags: introduction, awesome, nice
   :status: open
   :links: REQ_1

   Each need contains:

   * a **title** (required)
   * an **unique id** (optional) - gets generated based on the title if not given
   * a **description** (optional) - supports rst and sphinx extensions fully
   * a **status** (optional)
   * several **tags** (optional)
   * several **links** to other needs (optional)
   * project specific options (optional) - see :ref:`needs_extra_options`
   * a **layout** (optional)
   * a **style** (optional)

.. feature:: Filtering needs
   :id: FEATURE_1
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   We can easily :ref:`filter <filter>` **needs** and present them as :ref:`lists <needlist>`, :ref:`tables <needtable>`,
   :ref:`diagrams <needflow>`, and :ref:`pie charts <needpie>`.


**Table example**

.. needtable::
   :tags: introduction
   :style: table
   :columns: id, title, outgoing

**Diagram example**

.. needflow::
   :tags: introduction

.. feature:: Ex/Importing needs
   :id: FEATURE_2
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   For external synchronization (e.g. with JIRA, a spreadsheet,â€¦),
   the :ref:`needs builder <needs_builder>` can help export all created **needs** to a single *JSON* file.

   Also, there is support for importing needs from external files, which you can do by using the :ref:`needimport` directive.

   .. code-block:: bash

      make html   # HTML output
      make needs  # needs.json containing all data

.. feature:: Connect to external services
   :id: FEATURE_3
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   **Sphinx-Needs** can request issues and other data from external services like :ref:`GitHub <github_service>`.

   Embed tickets, requirements and other external information from specific services
   into your documentation by using :ref:`services`.

.. feature:: Automated data handling
   :id: FEATURE_4
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   To handle complex data chains between **needs**, you can use :ref:`dynamic_functions`
   to load and set changeable data automatically during the documentation generation phase.


.. feature:: Customizing everything
   :id: FEATURE_5
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1
   :layout: complete
   :style: green

   **Sphinx-Needs** allows customizing needs-types, needs-options, colors, layouts, IDs, checks, ....

   The pages :ref:`config` and :ref:`layouts_styles` contains instructions on how to adopt **Sphinx-Needs** for your
   processes and workflows.

.. feature:: API for other extensions
   :id: FEATURE_6
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   The :ref:`api` allows other Sphinx-extensions to build specific solutions around and with **Sphinx-Needs**.

   For instance, `Sphinx-Test-Reports <https://sphinx-test-reports.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ create **needs** from
   test results and make them searchable and linkable to other need-types.

.. feature:: Supports PlantUML for reusable Architecture elements
   :id: FEATURE_7
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   Sphinx-Needs allows to create specific objects for architecture elements, which can be reused  and recombined
   in different flows and also higher architecture elements. Based on `PlantUML <https://plantuml.com>`__.

   Take a look into the :ref:`needuml` directive to get an impression how powerful this mechanism is.


.. feature:: Developed for safe process executions
   :id: FEATURE_8
   :tags: introduction
   :links: SPEC_1

   **Sphinx-Needs** allows you to define the exact way of using and configuring **needs** objects.

   Use :ref:`needs_statuses`, :ref:`needs_tags` or :ref:`needs_warnings` to check for configurations not allowed,
   e.g. wrong status names.

   Or force the usage of specifically defined need-ids by setting :ref:`needs_id_required` and :ref:`needs_id_regex`.

   See :ref:`config` for more options to get a Sphinx documentation valid with ISO 26262, DO-178B/C or any other
   safety standard.

Input
~~~~~

.. code-block:: rst

   **Some data**

   .. req:: My first requirement
      :id: req_001
      :tags: main_example

      This need is a requirement, and it includes a title, an ID, a tag and this text as a description.

   .. spec:: Spec for a requirement
      :links: req_001
      :status: done
      :tags: important; main_example
      :collapse: false

      We didn't set the **ID** option here, so **Sphinx-Needs** will generate one for us.

      But we have set a **link** to our previous requirement and have set the **status** option.

      Also, we have enabled **collapse** to false to show all meta-data directly under the title.

   **Some text**

   Wohooo, we have created :need:`req_001`,
   which is linked by :need_incoming:`req_001`.

   **Some filters**

   Simple list:

   .. needlist::
     :tags: main_example

   Simple table:

   .. needtable::
     :tags: main_example
     :style: table

   A more powerful table
   (based on `DataTables <https://datatables.net/>`_):

   .. needtable::
     :tags: main_example
     :style: datatables


Result
~~~~~~

**Some data**

.. req:: My first requirement
   :id: req_001
   :tags: main_example

   This need is a requirement, and it includes a title, an ID, a tag and this text as a description.


.. spec:: Spec for a requirement
   :links: req_001
   :status: done
   :tags: important; main_example
   :collapse: false

   We didn't set the ``:id:`` option here, so **Sphinx-Needs** will generate one for us.

   But we have set a **link** to our previous requirement and have set the **status** option.

   Also, we have enabled **collapse** to false to show all meta-data directly under the title.

**Some text**

Wohooo, we have created :need:`req_001`,
which is linked by :need_incoming:`req_001`.

**Some filters**

:underline:`Simple list`:

.. needlist::
  :tags: main_example

:underline:`Simple table`:

.. needtable::
  :tags: main_example
  :style: table

:underline:`A more powerful table` (based on `DataTables <https://datatables.net/>`_):

.. needtable::
  :tags: main_example
  :style: datatables
