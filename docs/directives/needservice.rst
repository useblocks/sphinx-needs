needservice
===========
.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

``needservice`` allows the import of data from external services like GitHub.

|ex|

.. code-block:: rst

    .. needservice:: <service>
       :option: ...
       :status: open
       :tags: awesome, nice
       :author: me

       Extra content for each new need

In most cases, the service fetches requested data from an external server and creates a need object for each
found data-element in the returned data.

These need objects can then be used and referenced as all other need objects, e.g. by filtering them via
:ref:`needtable`.

.. hint::

   For details about available services and their specific configuration please take a look into
   :ref:`services`.

Options
-------
Each service can define custom options which may be needed for the service to work correctly.
Please take a look into the related service documentation to find out what is needed.

.. hint::

    ``needservice`` supports all options available for the :ref:`need` directive and
    all custom options defined by :ref:`needs_extra_options`.

For services provided by **Sphinx-Needs** please take a look into :ref:`services`.

.. _needservice_debug:

debug
~~~~~
Set ``debug`` to get debug-output of the ``needservice`` only. No needs will be created.

Useful to understand the return values of services or to figure out, why a connection can not be established.

|ex|

.. code-block:: rst

    .. needservice:: <service>
       :debug:


Content
-------
The content of ``needservice`` is used as content for all created need objects.

A service may deviate from this behavior and define its own usage.
For example, by awaiting a json-string with a more complex configuration or by just ignoring the content.

Please take a look into the related service documentation for more information.

GitHub Issues Example
---------------------
This example is using the ``github-issues`` service.
For details, please take a look into its specific documentation under :ref:`github_service`.

The service queries ``GitHub`` for issues in the **Sphinx-Needs** repository that have *node* and *latexpdf* in
their content.

|ex|

.. code-block:: rst

    .. needservice:: github-issues
       :query: repo:useblocks/sphinx-needs node latexpdf
       :max_content_lines: 4
       :id_prefix: EXAMPLE_


Click the small arrow under the need id to see all meta data.

|out|

.. needservice:: github-issues
   :query: repo:useblocks/sphinx-needs node latexpdf
   :max_amount: 1
   :id_prefix: EXAMPLE_
   :max_content_lines: 4
