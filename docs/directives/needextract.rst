needextract
===========

.. versionadded:: 0.5.1

``needextract`` generates copies of filtered needs with custom layout and style.

It supports custom creation of extracts from existing needs.
For instance, a supplier could get a copy of requirements but would not see all the internal meta-data.

|ex|

.. code-block:: rst

   .. needextract::
      :filter: type == 'feature'
      :layout: clean
      :style: green_border


.. note:: **needextract** supports the full filtering possibilities of **Sphinx-Needs**.
          Please read :ref:`filter` for more information.

``needextract`` supports also arguments as filter string. It works like the option `filter`, but also
supports need ID as filter argument.

|ex|

.. code-block:: rst

   .. needextract:: FEATURE_3
      :layout: clean
      :style: green_border

.. note:: arguments and option filter can't be used at the same time.
