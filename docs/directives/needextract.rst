needextract
===========

.. versionadded:: 0.5.1

``needextract`` generates copies of filtered needs with custom layout and style.

It supports custom creation of extracts from existing needs.
For instance, a supplier could get a copy of requirements but would not see all the internal meta-data.

.. need-example::

   .. feature:: A feature
      :id: EXTRACT_FEATURE_1

      This is a feature that should be extracted.

   .. needextract::
      :filter: id == 'EXTRACT_FEATURE_1'
      :layout: clean
      :style: green_border


.. note:: 
   
   **needextract** supports the full filtering possibilities of **Sphinx-Needs**.
   Please read :ref:`filter` for more information.

``needextract`` supports also arguments as filter string. It works like the option `filter`, but also
supports need ID as filter argument.

.. need-example::

   .. needextract:: EXTRACT_FEATURE_1
      :layout: clean
      :style: green_border

.. note:: arguments and option filter can't be used at the same time.
