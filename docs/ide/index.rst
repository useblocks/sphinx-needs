.. _ide_usage:

Usage
-----

To use all the Sphinx-Needs language featues,

#. Install IDE extension or plugin, see current supported IDE extension in :ref:`ide_installation`.

#. Build `needs.json` file in your Sphinx-Needs project:

 * automatically build `needs.json` if configure `needs_build_json = True` in conf.py. See details in :ref:`needs_build_json`.
 * manually build `needs.json` using `sphinx-build -b needs source_dir build_dir`. See details in :ref:`builders`.

Auto-generated need IDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_images/lsp_auto_ids.gif
   :align: center

Type ``:`` in the line directly below a need directive like ``.. req::`` and select ``:id:`` in the IntelliSense interface.

.. hint::

   * If needls can't detect the type of the need it will just output `ID`.
   * The ID is calculated using a hash function of the current user, doc URI, line number and the need prefix (e.g.).
     To lower the risk of ID conflicts further a pseudo-randomization is part of the ID generation.s

Predefined Snippets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /_images/lsp_snippets.gif

ID Selection

#. After `:need:` role or `:links:` option type `->` which triggers the auto-completion of needs
#. Select a need type from the IntelliSense dialog (use arrow keys)

   * Type `>` again to trigger the doc completion (file in which needs are specified)
   * Type `/` to complete the doc path, continue until the doc path is completed to a `*.rst` file
   * Type `>` to trigger completion of a specfic need by ID, expand the completion item info to see the content of the selected need

Goto Definition for need IDs
