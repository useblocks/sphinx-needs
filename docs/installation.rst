For the full configuration, please read :ref:`config`.

.. note::

   Prior version **1.0.1** the extensions was called ``sphinxcontrib.needs``.

.. _install_plantuml:

PlantUML support
----------------

:ref:`needflow` uses `PlantUML <http://plantuml.com>`_ and the
Sphinx-extension `sphinxcontrib-plantuml <https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-plantuml/>`_ for generating the flows.

Both must be available and correctly configured to work.


Install PlantUML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the latest version of the plantuml.jar file:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/plantuml/files/plantuml.jar/download
2. Make a new folder called ``utils`` inside your docs folder. Copy the ``plantuml.jar`` file into the ``utils`` folder.
3. Install the plantuml sphinx extension: ``pip install sphinxcontrib-plantuml``.
4. Add ``sphinxcontrib.plantuml`` to the sphinx extension list in ``conf.py``

.. code-block:: python

      extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.plantuml',
                    'sphinx_needs']


5. Configure plantuml in ``conf.py``

.. code-block:: python

  on_rtd = os.environ.get('READTHEDOCS') == 'True'
  if on_rtd:
      plantuml = 'java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar /usr/share/plantuml/plantuml.jar'
  else:
      plantuml = 'java -jar %s' % os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "utils", "plantuml.jar"))

      plantuml_output_format = 'png'

The final configuration contains already a setup for building and deploying the documentation on
`ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_.

ReadTheDocs provides ``plantuml.jar`` already on their system, so do not store it inside your source version control system.


Using Docker
------------

Sphinx-Needs is also available as a Docker Image.

See :ref:`docker` for the documentation and hints how to use it.
