.. _config:

Configuration
=============

All configurations take place in your project's **conf.py** file.

Activation
----------

Add **sphinx_needs** to your extensions.

.. code-block:: python

   extensions = ["sphinx_needs",]

.. _inc_build:

Incremental build support
-------------------------
Sphinx does not use its incremental build feature, if you assign functions directly to Sphinx options.
To avoid this, please use the :ref:`Sphinx-Needs API <api_configuration>` to register functions directly.

This would allow Sphinx to perform incremental builds which are much faster as compared to full builds.

**Example configuration**

.. code-block:: python

   # conf.py

   # Defining one or more functions in conf.py is fine
   def my_custom_warning(need, log):
       # some checks
       return False

   def my_dynamic_function(app, need, needs):
       return "some text"

   # This assignment will deactivate incremental build support inside Sphinx
   needs_warnings = {
      'my_warning_no_inc_build': my_custom_warning
   }

   # Better, register the function via Sphinx-Needs API
   from sphinx_needs.api.configuration import add_warning, add_dynamic_function
   def setup(app):
      add_warning(app, 'my_warning', my_custom_warning)
      add_dynamic_function(app, my_dynamic_function)

.. hint::

   You are free to use e.g. ``needs_warnings`` and ``add_warning()`` together in a **conf.py** file.
   **Sphinx-Needs** creates internally a final list of elements defined by config-var and api-call.

   However, you should not use the same ``id`` in a config-var and the related api-call, as this would create
   the related element twice.

Options
-------

All configuration options starts with the prefix ``needs_`` for **Sphinx-Needs**.

needs_include_needs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Set this option to False, if no needs should be documented inside the generated documentation.

Default: **True**

.. code-block:: python

    needs_include_needs = False

.. _needs_id_length:

needs_id_length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This option defines the length of an automated generated ID (the length of the prefix does not count).

Default: **5**

.. code-block:: python

    needs_id_length = 3

.. _needs_types:

needs_types
~~~~~~~~~~~

The option allows the setup of own need types like bugs, user_stories and more.

By default it is set to:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_types = [dict(directive="req", title="Requirement", prefix="R_", color="#BFD8D2", style="node"),
                   dict(directive="spec", title="Specification", prefix="S_", color="#FEDCD2", style="node"),
                   dict(directive="impl", title="Implementation", prefix="I_", color="#DF744A", style="node"),
                   dict(directive="test", title="Test Case", prefix="T_", color="#DCB239", style="node"),
                   # Kept for backwards compatibility
                   dict(directive="need", title="Need", prefix="N_", color="#9856a5", style="node")
               ]

``needs_types`` must be a list of dictionaries where each dictionary must contain the following items:

* **directive**: Name of the directive. For instance, you can use "req" via `.. req::` in documents
* **title**: Title, used as human readable name in lists
* **prefix**: A prefix for generated IDs, to easily identify that an ID belongs to a specific type. Can also be ""
* **color**: A color as hex value. Used in diagrams and some days maybe in other representations as well. Can also be ""
* **style**: A plantuml node type, like node, artifact, frame, storage or database. See `plantuml documentation <http://plantuml.com/deployment-diagram>`_ for more.

.. note::

   `color` can also be an empty string. This makes sense, if the PlantUMl configuration is mostly provided by using
   :ref:`needs_flow_configs` and the used colors shall not get overwritten by type specific values.

.. warning::

   If a need type shall contain :ref:`need_part` and later be printed via :ref:`needflow`,
   the chosen ``PlantUML`` node type must support nested elements for
   this type.

   Types who support nested elements are for instance: ``node``, ``package``, ``frame``.
   **Not supporting** elements are for instance ``usecase``, ``actor``.

   Please take a look into the  `PlantUML Manual <https://plantuml.com/>`_ for more details.


.. _needs_extra_options:

needs_extra_options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.2.2

The option allows the addition of extra options that you can specify on
needs.

You can set ``needs_extra_options`` as a list inside **conf.py** as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   needs_extra_options = ['introduced', 'updated', 'impacts']


And use it like:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. req:: My Requirement
      :status: open
      :introduced: Yes
      :updated: 2018/03/26
      :tags: important;complex;
      :impacts: really everything

Default value:

.. code-block:: python

   {'hidden': directives.unchanged}

The ``hidden`` option is a globally available option always hidden and used to easily execute :ref:`dynamic_functions`.

Extra options automatically appear in needs, if a value is set.
By using :ref:`needs_hide_options` the output of such options can be hidden.

.. note:: To filter on these options in `needlist`, `needtable`, etc. you
          must use the :ref:`filter` option.


.. dropdown:: Show example

   **conf.py**

   .. code-block:: python

      from docutils.parsers.rst import directives

      needs_extra_options = {
         "my_extra_option": directives.unchanged,
         "another_option": directives.unchanged,
         }

   **index.rst**

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. req:: My requirement with custom options
         :id: xyz_123
         :status: open
         :my_extra_option: A new option
         :another_option: filter_me

         Some content

      .. needfilter::
         :filter: "filter_me" in another_option

   **Result**

   .. req:: My requirement with custom options
      :id: xyz_123
      :status: open
      :my_extra_option: A new option
      :another_option: filter_me

      Some content

   .. needfilter::
      :filter: "filter_me" in another_option

.. _needs_global_options:

needs_global_options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.3.0

Global options are set on global level for all needs, so that all needs get the same value for the configured option.

.. code-block:: python

   needs_global_options = {
      'global_option': 'Fix value'
   }

Default value: ``{}``

You can combine global options with :ref:`dynamic_functions` to automate data handling.

.. code-block:: python

   needs_global_options = {
         'global_option': '[[copy("id")]]'
   }

.. _global_option_filters:

Filter based global options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. versionadded:: 0.4.3

You can set the value of a global_option if only a given :ref:`filter_string` passes.
If the filter string does not pass, the option is not set or a given default value is set.

To use filters for global_options, the given value must be a tuple containing the following elements:

#. value to set (required)
#. filter string, which must pass (required)
#. default value, if filter string does not pass (optional)


.. code-block:: python

   needs_global_options = {
      # Without default value
      'status': ('closed', 'status.lower() in ["done", "resolved", "closed"]')

      # Set Marco as author if security tag is used. In all other cases set Daniel as author.
      'author': ('Marco', '"security" in tags', 'Daniel)

      # Dynamic functions are allowed as well
      'req_id': ('[[copy("id")]]', 'id.startswith("REQ_")')
   }

There are use cases, for which an option needs to get different values based on different filter.
In this cases, you can provide a list of tuples.

.. code-block:: python

      needs_global_options = {
            # Without default value
            'status': [
                  ('fulfilled', 'status.lower() in ["done", "resolved", "closed"]', 'type=="req"'),
                  ('done', 'status.lower() in ["done", "resolved", "closed"]', 'type=="task"'),
                  ('implemented', 'status.lower() in ["done", "resolved", "closed"]', 'type=="spec"')
            ]
         }

.. warning::

   The filter string gets executed against the current need only and has no access to other needs.
   That's because the global_options get set during initialisation of the document and during this phase not every
   document has been already read by Sphinx.

   So avoid any references to other needs in the filter string.

   If you need access to other needs for complex filtering, you can maybe provide your own :ref:`dynamic_functions`
   and perform the filtering there.

.. _needs_report_dead_links:

needs_report_dead_links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deactivate/activate log messages of outgoing dead links. If set to ``False``, then deactivate.

Default value is ``True``.

Configuration example:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_report_dead_links = False

.. _needs_extra_links:

needs_extra_links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.3.11

Allows the definition of additional link types.

Each configured link should define:

* **option**: The name of the option. Example "blocks".
* **incoming**: Incoming text, to use for incoming links. E.g. "is blocked by".
* **outgoing**: Outgoing text, to use for outgoing links. E.g. "blocks".
* **copy** (optional): True/False. If True, the links will be copied also to the common link-list (link type ``links``).
  Default: True
* **allow_dead_links** (optional): True/False. If True, dead links are allowed and do not throw a warning.
  See :ref:`allow_dead_links` for details. Default: False.
* **style** (optional): A plantuml style description, e.g. "#FFCC00". Used for :ref:`needflow`. See :ref:`links_style`.
* **style_part** (optional): Same as **style**, but get used if link is connected to a :ref:`need_part`.
  See :ref:`links_style`.


Configuration example:

.. code-block:: python

   needs_extra_links = [
      {
         "option": "checks",
         "incoming": "is checked by",
         "outgoing": "checks",
      },
      {
         "option": "triggers",
         "incoming": "is triggered by",
         "outgoing": "triggers",
         "copy": False,
         "allow_dead_links": True,
         "style": "#00AA00",
         "style_part": "#00AA00",
         "style_start": "-",
         "style_end": "--o",
      }
   ]


The above example configuration allows the following usage:

|ex|

.. code-block:: rst

    .. req:: My requirement
      :id: EXTRA_REQ_001

    .. test:: Test of requirements
      :id: EXTRA_TEST_001
      :checks: EXTRA_REQ_001, DEAD_LINK_NOT_ALLOWED
      :triggers: DEAD_LINK


|out|

.. req:: My requirement
  :id: EXTRA_REQ_001

.. test:: Test of requirements
  :id: EXTRA_TEST_001
  :checks: EXTRA_REQ_001, DEAD_LINK_NOT_ALLOWED
  :triggers: DEAD_LINK


.. attention:: The used option name can not be reused in the configuration of :ref:`needs_global_options`.

Link types with option-name **links** and **parent_needs** are added by default.
You are free to overwrite the default config by defining your own type with option name **links** or **parent_needs**.
This type will be used as default configuration for all links.

.. _allow_dead_links:

allow_dead_links
++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 0.6.3

By setting ``allow_dead_links`` to ``True``, referenced, but not found needs do not throw a warning.
Instead the same text gets printed as log message on level ``INFO``.

Filtering
^^^^^^^^^
Need objects have the two attributes ``has_dead_links`` and ``has_forbidden_dead_links``.
``has_dead_links`` gets set to ``True``, if any dead link was found in the need.
And ``has_forbidden_dead_links`` is set to ``True`` only, if dead links were not allowed
(so ``allow_dead_links`` was set to ``False`` for at least one link type with dead links).

HTML style
^^^^^^^^^^

Also dead links get specific CSS attributes on the HTML output:
``needs_dead_link`` for all found dead links and an additional ``forbidden`` for link_types
with ``allow_dead_links`` not set or set to ``False``.

By default not allowed dead links will be shown in red , allowed ones in gray (see above example).


.. _links_style:

style / style_part
++++++++++++++++++

The style string can contain the following comma separated information:

* **color**: #ffcc00 or red
* **line style**: dotted, dashed, bold

Valid configuration examples are:

* ``#ffcc00``
* ``dashed``
* ``dotted,#red``

An empty string uses the default plantuml settings.

.. _needflow_style_start:

style_start / style_end
+++++++++++++++++++++++

These two options can define the arrow type, line type and line length.

See `Plantuml documentation page <https://plantuml.com/en/component-diagram>`_ for details about supported formats.

Here are some examples:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   - * description
     * style_start
     * style_end
   - * default
     * ``-``
     * ``->``
   - * reverse
     * ``<-``
     * ``-``
   - * Both sides, dotted line
     * ``<.``
     * ``.>``
   - * Deeper level / longer line
     * ``--``
     * ``->``

Use ``style_start`` and ``style_end`` like this:

.. code-block:: python

   needs_extra_links = [
      {
         "option": "tests",
         "incoming": "is tested by",
         "outgoing": "tests",
         "copy": False,
         "style_start": "<-",
         "style_end": "down-->",
         "style": "#00AA00",
         "style_part": "dotted,#00AA00",
      }
   ]

.. note::

   Some plantuml diagrams have restrictions in the order of color (`style`)
   and orientation (`left`, `rigth`, `up` and `down`). We suggest to set the orientation
   in `style_end` like in the example above, as this is more often supported.


.. _needs_filter_data:

needs_filter_data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option allows to use custom data inside a :ref:`filter_string`.

Configuration example:

.. code-block:: python

   def custom_defined_func():
       return "my_tag"

   needs_filter_data = {
       "current_variant": "project_x",
       "sphinx_tag": custom_defined_func(),
   }


The defined ``needs_filter_data`` must be a dictionary. Its values can be a string variable or a custom defined
function. The function get executed during config loading and must return a string.

The value of ``needs_filter_data`` will be available as data inside :ref:`filter_string` and can be very powerful
together with internal needs information to filter needs.

The defined extra filter data can be used like this:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. needextend:: type == "req" and sphinx_tag in tags
      :+tags: my_external_tag


or if project has :ref:`needs_extra_options` defined like:

.. code-block:: python

   needs_extra_options = ['variant']

The defined extra filter data can also be used like:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. needlist::
      :filter: variant != current_variant

   .. needextract::
      :filter: type == "story" and variant == current_variant
      :layout: clean
      :style: green_border


.. _needs_allow_unsafe_filters:

needs_allow_unsafe_filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allow unsafe filter for :ref:`filter_func`. Default is ``False``.

If set to True, the filtered results will keep all fields as they are returned by the dynamic functions.
Fields can be added or existing fields can even be manipulated.

.. note::

   Keep in mind this only affects the filter results, original needs as displayed somewhere else are not modified.

If set to False, the filter results contains the original need fields and any manipulations of need fields are lost.

|ex|

.. code-block:: python

   needs_allow_unsafe_filters = True

.. _needs_flow_show_links:

needs_flow_show_links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.3.11

Used to de/activate the output of link type names beside the connection in the :ref:`needflow` directive:

.. code-block:: python

   needs_flow_show_links = True


Default value: ``False``

Can be configured also for each :ref:`needflow` directive via :ref:`needflow_show_link_names`.

.. _needs_flow_link_types:

needs_flow_link_types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.3.11

Defines the link_types to show in a :ref:`needflow` diagram:

.. code-block:: python

   needs_flow_link_types = ['links', 'blocks', 'tests']

You can define this setting on each specific ``needflow`` by using the :ref:`needflow` directive option :ref:`needflow_link_types`.
See also :ref:`needflow_link_types` for more details.

Default value: ``['links']``

.. _needs_flow_configs:

needs_flow_configs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.5.2

``needs_flow_configs`` must be a dictionary which can store multiple `PlantUML configurations <https://plantuml.com/>`_.
These configs can then be selected when using :ref:`needflow`.

.. code-block:: python

   needs_flow_configs = {
      'my_config': """
          skinparam monochrome true
          skinparam componentStyle uml2
      """,
      'another_config': """
          skinparam class {
              BackgroundColor PaleGreen
              ArrowColor SeaGreen
              BorderColor SpringGreen
          }
      """
   }

This configurations can then be used like this:

|ex|

.. code-block:: rst

   .. needflow::
      :tags: flow_example
      :types: spec
      :config: my_config

|out|

.. needflow::
   :tags: flow_example
   :types: spec
   :config: my_config

See :ref:`needflow config option <needflow_config>` for more details and already available configurations.

.. _needs_report_template:

needs_report_template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.0.1

You can customize the layout of :ref:`needreport` using `Jinja <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__.

Set the value of ``needs_report_template`` to the path of the template you want to use.

.. note::

   The path must be an absolute path based on the **conf.py** directory.
   Example: ``needs_report_template = '/needs_templates/report_template.need'``

   The template file should be a plain file with any of the following file extensions: ``.rst``, ``.need``, or ``.txt``.

If you do not set ``needs_report_template``, the default template used is:

.. code-block:: jinja

   {% raw -%}

   {# Output for needs_types #}
   {% if types|length != 0 %}
   .. dropdown:: Need Types
      :class: needs_report_table

The plugin provides the following variables which you can use in your custom Jinja template:

* types - list of :ref:`need types <needs_types>`
* links - list of :ref:`extra need links <needs_extra_links>`
* options - list of :ref:`extra need options <needs_extra_options>`
* usage - a dictionary object containing information about the following:
    + needs_amount -> total amount of need objects in the project
    + needs_types -> number of need objects per needs type

needs_diagram_template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option allows to control the content of diagram elements which get automatically generated by using
`.. needflow::` / :ref:`needflow`.

This function is based on `plantuml <http://plantuml.com>`_, so that each
`supported style <http://plantuml.com/creole>`_ can be used.

The rendered template is used inside the following plantuml syntax and must care about leaving the final string
valid:

.. code-block:: python

    'node "YOUR_TEMPLATE" as need_id [[need_link]]'

By default the following template is used:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% raw -%}
    {%- if is_need -%}
    <size:12>{{type_name}}</size>\\n**{{title|wordwrap(15, wrapstring='**\\\\n**')}}**\\n<size:10>{{id}}</size>
    {%- else -%}
    <size:12>{{type_name}} (part)</size>\\n**{{content|wordwrap(15, wrapstring='**\\\\n**')}}**\\n<size:10>{{id_parent}}.**{{id}}**</size>
    {%- endif -%}
    {% endraw %}


.. _needs_id_required:

needs_id_required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.1.19

Forces the user to set an ID for each need, which gets defined.

So no ID is autogenerated any more, if this option is set to True:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_id_required = True

By default this option is set to **False**.

If an ID is missing Sphinx throws the exception "NeedsNoIdException" and stops the build.

**Example**:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. With needs_id_required = True

    .. req:: Working Requirement
       :id: R_001

    .. req:: **Not working**, because :id: is not set.


    .. With needs_id_required = False

    .. req:: This works now!

.. _needs_id_from_title:

needs_id_from_title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generates needs ID from title. By default, this setting is set to **False**.

When no need ID is given by the user, and `needs_id_from_title` is set to **True**, then a need ID
will be calculated based on the current need directive prefix, title, and a hased value from title.

|ex|

.. code-block:: rst

    .. req:: Group big short
    
The calculated need ID will be: `R_GROUP_BIG_SHORT_{hashed value}`, if the need ID length doesn't
exceed the setting from :ref:`needs_id_length`.

.. note::

   The user needs to ensure the uniqueness of the given title, and also match the settings of 
   :ref:`needs_id_length` and :ref:`needs_id_regex`.

.. _needs_title_optional:

needs_title_optional
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.2.3

Normally a title is required to follow the need directive as follows:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. req:: This is the required title
        :id: R_9999

By default this option is set to **False**.

When this option is set to **True**, a title does not need to be provided, but
either some content or an `:id:` element will be required.  If a title is not
provided and no ID is provided, then an ID will be generated based on the
content of the requirement.

It is important to note in these scenarios that titles will not be available
in other directives such as needtable, needlist, needflow.

A title can be auto-generated for a requirement by either setting
:ref:`needs_title_from_content` to **True** or providing the flag
`:title_from_content:` as follows:

|ex|

.. code-block:: rst

    .. req::
        :title_from_content:

        This will be my title.  Anything after the first sentence will not be
        part of the title.

The resulting requirement would have the title derived from the first
sentence of the requirement.

|out|

.. req::
    :title_from_content:

    This will be my title.  Anything after the first sentence will not be
    part of the title.


.. _needs_title_from_content:

needs_title_from_content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.2.3

This setting defaults to **False**. When set to **True** and a need does
not provide a title, then a title will be generated using the first sentence
in the content of the requirement.  The length of the title will adhere to the needs_max_title_length_
setting (which is not limited by default).

.. note::

   When using this setting be sure to exercise caution that special formatting
   that you would not want in the title (bulleted lists, nested directives, etc.)
   do not appear in the first sentence.

If a title is specified for an individual requirement, then that title
will be used over the generated title.

|ex|

.. code-block:: rst

    .. req::

        The tool must have error logging.  All critical errors must be
        written to the console.


This will render the first sentence as the title

.. req::

    The tool must have error logging.  All critical errors must be
    written to the console.


.. _needs_max_title_length:

needs_max_title_length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option is used in conjunction with auto-generated titles as controlled by
needs_title_from_content_ and :ref:`title_from_content`. By default, there is no
limit to the length of a title.

If you provide a maximum length and the generated title exceeds that limit,
then we use an elided version of the title.

When generating a requirement ID from the title, the full generated title will
still be used.

Example:

.. req::
    :title_from_content:

    This is a requirement with a very long title that will need to be
    shortened to prevent our titles from being too long.
    Additional content can be provided in the requirement and not be part
    of the title.

.. _needs_show_link_type:

needs_show_link_type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.1.27

This option mostly affects the roles :ref:`role_need_outgoing` and :ref:`role_need_incoming` by showing
the *type* beside the ID of the linked need.

Can be combined with **needs_show_link_title**.

Activate it by setting it on True in your **conf.py**:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_show_link_type = True

.. _needs_show_link_title:

needs_show_link_title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.1.27

This option mostly affects the roles :ref:`role_need_outgoing` and :ref:`role_need_incoming` by showing
the *title* beside the ID of the linked need.

Can be combined with **needs_show_link_type**.

Activate it by setting it on True in your **conf.py**:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_show_link_title = True

.. _needs_show_link_id:

needs_show_link_id
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 1.0.3

This option mostly affects the roles :ref:`role_need_outgoing` and :ref:`role_need_incoming` by showing
the *ID*  of the linked need.

Can be combined with :ref:`needs_show_link_type` and :ref:`needs_show_link_title`.


.. code-block:: python

    needs_show_link_id = True

.. _needs_file:

needs_file
~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.1.30

Defines the location of a JSON file, which is used by the builder :ref:`needs_builder` as input source.
Default value: *needs.json*.

.. _needs_statuses:

needs_statuses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.1.41

Defines a set of valid statuses, which are allowed to be used inside documentation.
If we detect a status not defined, an error is thrown and the build stops.
The checks are case sensitive.

Activate it by setting it like this:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_statuses = [
        dict(name="open", description="Nothing done yet"),
        dict(name="in progress", description="Someone is working on it"),
        dict(name="implemented", description="Work is done and implemented"),
    ]

If parameter is not set or set to *False*, no checks will be performed.

Default value: *[]*.

.. _needs_tags:

needs_tags
~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.1.41

Defines a set of valid tags, which are allowed to be used inside documentation.
If we detect a tag not defined, an error is thrown and the build stops.
The checks are case sensitive.

Activate it by setting it like this:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_tags = [
        dict(name="new", description="new needs"),
        dict(name="security", description="tag for security needs"),
    ]

If parameter is not set or set to *[]*, no checks will be performed.

Default value: *[]*.


.. _needs_css:

needs_css
~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.1.42

Defines the location of a CSS file, which will be added during documentation build.

If path is relative, **Sphinx-Needs** will search for related file in its own CSS-folder only!
Currently supported CSS files:

* **blank.css** : CSS file with empty styles
* **modern.css**: modern styles for a need (default)
* **dark.css**: styles for dark page backgrounds

Use it like this:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_css = "blank.css"


To provide your own CSS file, the path must be absolute. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    conf_py_folder = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    needs_css =  os.path.join(conf_py_folder, "my_styles.css")

See :ref:`styles_css` for available CSS selectors and more.


.. _needs_role_need_template:

needs_role_need_template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.1.48

Provides a way of changing the text representation of a referenced need.

If you use the role :ref:`role_need`, **Sphinx-Needs** will create a text representation of the referenced need.
By default a referenced need is described by the following string:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {title} ({id})

By using ``needs_role_need_template`` this representation can be easily adjusted to own requirements.

Here are some ideas, how it could be used inside the **conf.py** file:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_role_need_template = "[{id}]: {title}"
    needs_role_need_template = "-{id}-"
    needs_role_need_template = "{type}: {title} ({status})"
    needs_role_need_template = "{title} ({tags})"
    needs_role_need_template = "{title:*^20s} - {content:.30}"
    needs_role_need_template = "[{id}] {title} ({status}) {type_name}/{type} - {tags} - {links} - {links_back} - {content}"

``needs_role_need_template`` must be a string, which supports the following placeholders:

* id
* type (short version)
* type_name (long, human readable version)
* title
* status
* tags, joined by ";"
* links, joined by ";"
* links_back, joined by ";"
* content

All options of Python's `.format() <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#format>`_ function are supported.
Please see https://pyformat.info/ for more information.

RST-attributes like ``**bold**`` are **not** supported.

.. _needs_role_need_max_title_length:

needs_role_need_max_title_length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.3.14

Defines the maximum length of need title that is shown in need references.

By default, need titles that are longer than 30 characters are shortened when
shown in :ref:`role_need` text representation and "..." is added at end. By
using ``needs_role_need_max_title_length``, it is possible to change this
maximum length.

If set to -1 the title will never be shortened.

.. code-block:: python

    # conf.py
    needs_role_need_max_title_length = 45

.. _needs_table_style:

needs_table_style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.2.0

Defines the default style for each table. Can be overridden for specific tables by setting parameter
:ref:`needtable_style` of directive :ref:`needtable`.

.. code-block:: python

    # conf.py
    needs_table_style = "datatables"

Default value: ``"datatables"``

Supported values:

* **table**: Default Sphinx table
* **datatables**: Table with activated DataTables functions (Sort, search, export, ...).


.. _needs_table_columns:

needs_table_columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.2.0

Defines the default columns for each table. Can be overridden for specific tables by setting parameter
:ref:`needtable_columns` of directive :ref:`needtable`.

.. code-block:: python

    # conf.py
    needs_table_columns = "title;status;tags"

Default value: ``"id;title;status;type;outgoing;tags"``

Supported values:

* id
* title
* status
* type
* tags
* incoming
* outgoing

.. _needs_id_regex:

needs_id_regex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0

Defines a regular expression used to validate all manually set IDs and to generate valid IDs for needs
without a given ID.

Default value: ``^[A-Z0-9_]{5,}``

By default, an ID is allowed to contain upper characters, numbers and underscore only.
The ID length must be at least 3 characters.

.. warning::

   An automatically generated ID of needs without a manually given ID must match
   the default value of needs_id_regex only.

   If you change the regular expression, you should also set :ref:`needs_id_required`
   so that authors are forced to set an valid ID.

.. _needs_functions:

needs_functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.3.0

Used to register own dynamic functions.

Must be a list of python functions.

Default value: ``[]``

Inside your **conf.py** file use it like this:

.. code-block:: python

   needs_functions == [my_own_function]

   def my_own_function(app, need, needs):
       return "Awesome"

See :ref:`dynamic_functions` for more information.

.. warning::

   Assigning a function to a Sphinx option will deactivate the incremental build feature of Sphinx.
   Please use the :ref:`Sphinx-Needs API <api_configuration>` and read :ref:`inc_build` for details.

It is better to use the following way in your **conf.py** file:

.. code-block:: python

     from sphinx_needs.api import add_dynamic_function

        def my_function(app, need, needs, *args, **kwargs):
            # Do magic here
            return "some data"

        def setup(app):
              add_dynamic_function(app, my_function)



.. _needs_part_prefix:

needs_part_prefix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.3.6

String used as prefix for :ref:`need_part` output in :ref:`tables <needtable_show_parts>`.

Default value: ``u'\u2192\u00a0'``

The default value contains an arrow right and a non breaking space.

.. code-block:: python

   needs_part_prefix = u'\u2192\u00a0'

See :ref:`needtable_show_parts` for an example output.


.. _needs_warnings:

needs_warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.5.0

``needs_warnings`` allows the definition of warnings which all needs must avoid during a Sphinx build.

A raised warning will print a sphinx-warning during build time.

Use ``-W`` in your Sphinx build command to stop the whole build, if a warning is raised.
This will handle **all warnings** as exceptions.

.. code-block:: python

   def my_custom_warning_check(need, log):
       if need["status"] == "open":
           log.info(f"{need['id']} status must not be 'open'.")
           return True
       return False


   needs_warnings = {
     # req need must not have an empty status field
     'req_with_no_status': "type == 'req' and not status",

     # status must be open or closed
     'invalid_status' : "status not in ['open', 'closed']",

     # user defined filter code function
     'type_match': my_custom_warning_check,
   }

``needs_warnings`` must be a dictionary.
The **dictionary key** is used as identifier and gets printed in log outputs.
The **value** must be a valid filter string or a custom defined filter code function and defines a *not allowed behavior*.

So use the filter string or filter code function to define how needs are not allowed to be configured/used.
The defined filter code function must return ``True`` or ``False``.

.. warning::

   Assigning a function to a Sphinx option will deactivate the incremental build feature of Sphinx.
   Please use the :ref:`Sphinx-Needs API <api_configuration>` and read :ref:`inc_build` for details.

Example output:

.. code-block:: text

  ...
  looking for now-outdated files... none found
  pickling environment... done
  checking consistency... WARNING: Sphinx-Needs warnings were raised. See console / log output for details.

  Checking Sphinx-Needs warnings
    type_check: passed
    invalid_status: failed
        failed needs: 11 (STYLE_005, EX_ROW_1, EX_ROW_3, copy_2, clv_1, clv_2, clv_3, clv_4, clv_5, T_C3893, R_AD4A0)
        used filter: status not in ["open", "in progress", "closed", "done"] and status is not None

    type_match: failed
        failed needs: 1 (TC_001)
        used filter: <function my_custom_warning_check at 0x7faf3fbcd1f0>
  done
  ...

Due to the nature of Sphinx logging, a sphinx-warning may be printed wherever in the log.

.. _needs_warnings_always_warn:

needs_warnings_always_warn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If set to ``True``, will allow you to log :ref:`needs_warnings` not passed into a given file if using your Sphinx build
command with ``-w``.

Default: ``False``.

For example, set this option to True:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_warnings_always_warn = True

Using Sphinx build command ``sphinx-build -M html {srcdir} {outdir} -w error.log``, all the :ref:`needs_warnings` not passed will be
logged into a **error.log** file as you specified.

If you use ``sphinx-build -M html {srcdir} {outdir} -W -w error.log``, the first :ref:`needs_warnings` not passed will stop the build and
be logged into the file error.log.

.. _needs_layouts:

needs_layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.5.0

You can use ``needs_layouts`` to define custom grid-based layouts with custom data.

Please read :ref:`layouts_styles` for a lot more detailed information.

``needs_layouts`` must be a dictionary and each key represents a layout. A layout must define the used grid-system and
a layout-structure.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_layouts = {
        'my_layout': {
            'grid': 'simple',
            'layout': {
                'head': ['my custom head'],
                'meta': ['my first meta line',
                         'my second meta line']
            }
        }
    }

.. note::

   **Sphinx-Needs** provides some default layouts. These layouts cannot be overwritten.
   See :ref:`layout list <layouts>` for more information.

.. _needs_default_layout:

needs_default_layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.5.0

``needs_default_layout`` defines the layout to use by default.

The name of the layout must have been provided by **Sphinx-Needs** or by user via
configuration :ref:`needs_layouts`.

Default value of ``needs_default_layout`` is ``clean``.

.. code-block:: python

      needs_default_layout = 'my_own_layout'

.. _needs_default_style:

needs_default_style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.5.0

The value of ``needs_default_style`` is used as default value for each need which does not define its own
style information via ``:style:`` option.

See :ref:`styles` for a list of default style names.

.. code-block:: python

   needs_default_layout = 'border_yellow'


A combination of multiple styles is possible:

.. code-block:: python

   needs_default_style = 'blue, green_border'

Custom values can be set as well, if your projects provides the needed CSS-files for it.

.. _needs_template_folder:

needs_template_folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.5.2

``needs_template_folder`` allows the definition of your own **Sphinx-Needs** template folder.
By default this is ``needs_templates/``.

The folder must already exist, otherwise an exception gets thrown, if a need tries to use a template.

Read also :ref:`need_template option description <need_template>` for information of how to use templates.

.. _needs_duration_option:

needs_duration_option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.5.5

Used to define option to store ``duration`` information for :ref:`needgantt`.

See also :ref:`needgantt_duration_option`, which overrides this value for specific ``needgantt`` charts.

Default: :ref:`need_duration`

.. _needs_completion_option:

needs_completion_option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.5.5

Used to define option to store ``completion`` information for :ref:`needgantt`.

See also :ref:`needgantt_completion_option`, which overrides this value for specific ``needgantt`` charts.

Default: :ref:`need_completion`

.. _needs_services:

needs_services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

Takes extra configuration options for :ref:`services`:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_services = {
        'jira': {
            'url': 'my_jira_server.com',
        },
        'git': {
            'url': 'my_git_server.com',
        },
        'my_service': {
            'class': MyServiceClass,
            'config_1': 'value_x',
        }
    }

Each key-value-pair in ``needs_services`` describes a service specific configuration.

Own services can be registered by setting ``class`` as additional option.

Config options are service specific and are described by :ref:`services`.

See also :ref:`needservice`.

.. _needs_service_all_data:

needs_service_all_data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

If set to ``True``, data for options which are unknown, is added as string to the need content.
If ``False``, unknown option data is not shown anywhere.

Default: ``False``.

.. code-block:: python

    needs_service_all_data = True


{% raw %}

.. _needs_external_needs:

needs_external_needs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.7.0

Allows to reference and use external needs without having their representation in your own documentation.
(Unlike :ref:`needimport`, which creates need-objects from a local ``needs.json`` only).

.. code-block:: python

    needs_external_needs = [
      {
        'base_url': 'http://mydocs/my_project',
        'json_url':  'http://mydocs/my_project/needs.json',
        'version': '1.0',
        'id_prefix': 'ext_',
        'css_class': 'external_link',
      },
      {
        'base_url': 'http://mydocs/another_project/',
        'json_path':  'my_folder/needs.json',
        'version': '2.5',
        'id_prefix': 'other_',
        'css_class': 'project_x',
      },
      {
        'base_url': '<relative_path_from_my_build_html_to_my_project>/<relative_path_to_another_project_build_html>',
        'json_path':  'my_folder/needs.json',
        'version': '2.5',
        'id_prefix': 'ext_',
        'css_class': 'project_x',
      },
      {
        "base_url": "http://my_company.com/docs/v1/",
        "target_url": "issue/{{need['id']}}",
        "json_path": "needs_test.json",
        "id_prefix": "ext_need_id_",
      },
      {
        "base_url": "http://my_company.com/docs/v1/",
        "target_url": "issue/{{need['type']|upper()}}",
        "json_path": "needs_test.json",
        "id_prefix": "ext_need_type_",
      },
      {
        "base_url": "http://my_company.com/docs/v1/",
        "target_url": "issue/fixed_string",
        "json_path": "needs_test.json",
        "id_prefix": "ext_string_",
      },
    ]

``needs_external_needs`` must be a list of dictionary elements and each dictionary must/can have the following
keys:

:base_url: Base url which is used to calculate the final, specific need url. Normally the path under which the ``index.html`` is provided.
           Base url supports also relative path, which starts from project build html folder (normally where ``index.html`` is located).
:target_url: Allows to config the final caculated need url. (*optional*)
             |br| If provided, ``target_url`` will be appended to ``base_url`` as the final calculate need url, e.g. ``base_url/target_url``.
             If not, the external need url uses the default calculated ``base_url``.
             |br| The ``target_url`` supports Jinja context ``{{need[]}}``, ``need option`` used as key, e.g ``{{need['id']}}`` or ``{{need['type']}}``.
:json_url: An url, which can be used to download the ``needs.json`` (or similar) file.
:json_path: The path to a ``needs.json`` file located inside your documentation project. Can not be used together with
            ``json_url``. |br| The value must be a relative path, which is relative to the project configuration folder
            (where the **conf.py** is stored). (Since version `0.7.1`)
:version: Defines the version to use inside the ``needs.json`` file (*optional*).
:id_prefix: Prefix as string, which will be added to all id of external needs. Needed, if there is the risk that
            needs from different projects may have the same id (*optional*).
:css_class: A class name as string, which gets set in link representations like :ref:`needtable`.
            The related CSS class definition must be done by the user, e.g. by :ref:`own_css`.
            (*optional*) (*default*: ``external_link``)

{% endraw %}

.. _needs_needextend_strict:

needs_needextend_strict
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 1.0.3

``needs_needextend_strict`` allows you to deactivate or activate
the :ref:`strict <needextend_strict>` option behaviour for all :ref:`needextend` directives.

.. _needs_table_classes:

needs_table_classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.7.2

Allows to define custom CSS classes which get set for the HTML tables of  ``need`` and ``needtable``.
This may be needed to avoid custom table handling of some specific Sphinx theme like ReadTheDocs.

.. code-block:: python

   needs_table_classes = ['my_custom_class', 'another_class']

Default: ``['rtd-exclude-wy-table', 'no-sphinx-material-strip']``

This classes are not set for needtables using the ``table`` style, which is using the normal Sphinx table layout
and therefore must be handled by themes.

The following themes support the following table classes to deactivate their specific handling:

.. list-table::

   - * Theme
     * Class
   - * ReadTheDocs
     * ``rtd-exclude-wy-table``
   - * Sphinx-Material
     * ``no-sphinx-material-strip``

.. hint::

   The deactivation of theme specific table handling is quite a new feature in most themes.
   Please be sure to use the newest theme version or even the nightly build.


.. _needs_builder_filter:

needs_builder_filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.7.2

Defines a :ref:`filter_string` used to filter needs for the builder :ref:`needs_builder`.

Default is ``'is_external==False'``, so all locally defined need objects are taken into account.
Need objects imported via :ref:`needs_external_needs` get sorted out.

.. code-block:: python

   needs_builder_filter = 'status=="open"'

.. _needs_string_links:

needs_string_links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 0.7.4

Transforms a given option value to a link.

Helpful e.g. to generate a link to a ticket system based on the given ticket number only.

.. code-block:: python

    needs_string_links = {
        'custom_name': {
            'regex': "...",
            'link_url' : "...",
            'link_name': '...'
            'options': ['status', '...']
        }
    }

:regex: Must be a valid regular expression. Named capture groups are supported.
:link_url: The final url as string. Supports Jinja.
:link_name: The final link name as string. Supports Jinja.
:options: List of option names, for which the regex shall be checked.

``link_name`` and ``link_url`` support the `Jinja2 <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com>`__ syntax.
All named capture group values get injected, so that parts of the option-value can be reused for
link name and url.

**Example**:
{% raw %}

.. code-block:: python

    # conf.py

    needs_string_links = {
        # Adds link to the Sphinx-Needs configuration page
        'config_link': {

   .. spec:: Use needs_string_links
      :id: EXAMPLE_STRING_LINKS

.. spec:: Use needs_string_links
   :id: EXAMPLE_STRING_LINKS
   :config: needs_string_links
   :github: 404,652

   Replaces the string from ``:config:`` and ``:github:`` with a link to the related website.

.. note::

   You must define the options specified under :ref:`needs_string_links` inside :ref:`needs_extra_options` as well.

.. _needs_build_json:

needs_build_json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.7.6

Builds a ``needs.json`` file during other builds, like ``html``.

This allows to have one single Sphinx-Build for two output formats, which may save some time.

All other ``needs.json`` related configuration values, like :ref:`needs_file`, are taken into account.

Default: False

Example:

.. code-block:: python

      needs_build_json = True

.. hint::

   The created ``needs.json`` file gets stored in the ``outdir`` of the current builder.
   So if ``html`` is used as builder, the final location is e.g. ``_build/html/needs.json``.

.. _needs_build_needumls:

needs_build_needumls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exports :ref:`needuml` data during each build.

This option works like :ref:`needs_build_json`. But the value of :ref:`needs_build_needumls` should be a string,
not a boolean. Default value of is: ``""``.

This value of this option shall be a **relative folder path**, which specifies and creates the relative folder in the
``outdir`` of the current builder.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_build_needumls = "my_needumls"

As a result, all the :ref:`needuml` data will be exported into folder in the ``outdir`` of the current builder, e.g. ``_build/html/my_needumls/``.

.. _needs_permalink_file:

needs_permalink_file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The option specifies the name of the permalink html file,
which will be copied to the html build directory during build.

The permalink web site will load a ``needs.json`` file as specified
by :ref:`needs_permalink_data` and re-direct the web browser to the html document
of the need, which is specified by appending the need ID as a query
parameter, e.g., ``http://localhost:8000/permalink.html?id=REQ_4711``. 

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    needs_permalink_file = "my_permalink.html"

Results in a file ``my_permalink.html`` in the
html build directory.
If this directory is served on ``localhost:8000``, then the file will be
available at ``http://localhost:8000/my_permalink.html``.

Default value: ``permalink.html``

.. _needs_permalink_data:

needs_permalink_data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This options sets the location of a ``needs.json`` file. 
This file is used to create permanent links for needs as described 
in :ref:`needs_permalink_file`.

The path can be a relative path (relative to the permalink html file),
an absolute path (on the web server) or an URL.

Default value: ``needs.json``


.. _needs_constraints:

needs_constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.0.1

.. code-block:: python

    needs_constraints = {

        "critical": {
            "check_0": "'critical' in tags",
            "check_1": "'security_req' in links",
            "severity": "CRITICAL"
        },

        "security": {
            "check_0": "'security' in tags",
            "severity": "HIGH"
        },

        "team": {
            "check_0": "author == \"Bob\"",
            "severity": "LOW"
        },

    }

needs_constraints needs to be enabled by adding "constraints" to :ref:`needs_extra_options`

needs_constraints contains a dictionary which contains dictionaries describing a single constraint. A single constraint's name serves as the key for the inner dictionary.
Inside there are (multiple) checks and a severity. Each check describes an executable constraint which allows to set conditions the specific need has to fulfill.
Depending on the severity, different behaviours in case of failure can be configured. See :ref:`needs_constraint_failed_options`

Each need now contains additional attributes named "constraints_passed" and "constraints_results".

constraints_passed is a bool showing if ALL constraints of a corresponding need were passed.

constraints_results is a dictionary similar in structure to needs_constraints above. Instead of executable python statements, inner values contain a bool describing if check_0, check_1 ... passed successfully.


.. code-block:: rst

    .. req::
        :id: SECURITY_REQ

        This is a requirement describing security processes.

    .. req::
        :tags: critical
        :links: SECURITY_REQ
        :constraints: critical

        Example of a successful constraint.

    .. req::
        :id: FAIL_01
        :author: "Alice"
        :constraints: team

        Example of a failed constraint with medium severity. Note the style from :ref:`needs_constraint_failed_options`


.. req::
    :id: SECURITY_REQ

    This is a requirement describing security processes.

.. req::
    :tags: critical
    :links: SECURITY_REQ
    :constraints: critical

    Example of a successful constraint.

.. req::
    :id: FAIL_01
    :author: "Alice"
    :constraints: team

    Example of a failed constraint with medium severity. Note the style from :ref:`needs_constraint_failed_options`

.. _needs_constraint_failed_options:

needs_constraint_failed_options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    needs_constraint_failed_options = {
        "CRITICAL": {
            "on_fail": ["warn"],
            "style": ["red_bar"],
            "force_style": True
        },

        "HIGH": {
            "on_fail": ["warn"],
            "style": ["orange_bar"],
            "force_style": True
        },

        "MEDIUM": {
            "on_fail": ["warn"],
            "style": ["yellow_bar"],
            "force_style": False
        },

        "LOW": {
            "on_fail": [],
            "style": ["yellow_bar"],
            "force_style": False
        }
    }

needs_constraint_failed_options must be a dictionary which stores what to do if a certain constraint fails.
Dictionary keys correspond to the severity set when creating a constraint.
Each entry describes in an "on_fail" action what to do:

- "break" breaks the build process and raises a NeedsConstraintFailed Exception when a constraint is not met.
- "warn" creates a warning in the sphinx.logger if a constraint is not met. Use -W in your Sphinx build command
  to stop the whole build, if a warning is raised. This will handle all warnings as exceptions.

"style" sets the style of the failed object see :ref:`styles` for available styles. **Please be aware of conflicting styles!**

If "force style" is set, all other styles are removed and just the constraint_failed style remains.

.. _needs_variants:

needs_variants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 1.0.2

``needs_variants`` configuration option must be a dictionary which has pre-defined variants assigned to
"filter strings". The filter string defines which variant a need belongs in the current situations.

|ex|

In ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   needs_variants = {
     "var_a": "'var_a' in sphinx_tags"  # filter_string
     "var_b": "assignee == 'me'"
   }

The dictionary consists of key-value pairs where the key is a string used as a reference to the value.
The value is a string which consists of a Python-supported "filter string".

Default: ``{}``

.. _needs_variant_options:

needs_variant_options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 1.0.2

``needs_variant_options`` must be a list which consists of the options to apply variants handling.
You can specify the names of the options you want to check for variants.

|ex|

In ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   needs_variant_options = ["author", "status", "tags"]

From the example above, we apply variants handling to only the options specified.

Default: ``[]``

.. note::

   1. You must ensure the options in ``needs_variant_options`` are either default need options or specified in
      :ref:`extra options <needs_extra_options>` or :ref:`extra links <needs_extra_links>`.
   2. By default, if ``needs_variant_options`` is empty, we deactivate variants handling for need options.

.. _needs_render_context:

needs_render_context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 1.0.3

This option allows you to use custom data as context when rendering `Jinja <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/>`__ templates or strings.

Configuration example:

.. code-block:: python

    def custom_defined_func():
        return "my_tag"

    def sum_example(number_1, number_2):
        return number_1 + number_2

    needs_render_context = {
        "custom_data_1": "Project_X",
        "custom_data_2": custom_defined_func(),
        "custom_data_3": True,
        "custom_data_4": [("Daniel", 811982), ("Marco", 234232)],
        "sum_example": sum_example
    }

The``needs_render_context`` configuration option must be a dictionary.
The dictionary consists of key-value pairs where the key is a string used as reference to the value.
The value can be any data type (string, integer, list, dict, etc.) or a custom defined function, which return
value is used or the function itself can be used (see ``sum_example``).

The data passed via needs_render_context will be available as variable(s) when rendering Jinja templates or strings.
You can use the data passed via needs_render_context as shown below:

|ex|

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% raw -%}

    .. req:: Need with jinja_content enabled
       :id: JINJA1D8913
       :jinja_content: true

       Need with alias {{ custom_data_1 }} and ``jinja_content`` option set to {{ custom_data_3 }}.

       4 + 5 = {{ sum_example(4,5) }}

       {{ custom_data_2 }}
       {% for author in custom_data_4 %}
          * author[0]
            + author[1]
       {% endfor %}

    {% endraw %}

{% raw -%}

.. req:: Need with jinja_content enabled
   :id: JINJA1D8913
   :jinja_content: true

   Need with alias {{ custom_data_1 }} and ``jinja_content`` option set to {{ custom_data_3 }}.

   {{ custom_data_2 }}
   {% for author in custom_data_4 %}
   * {{ author[0] }} --> ID-{{ author[1] }}
   {% endfor %}

{% endraw %}


.. _needs_debug_measurement:

needs_debug_measurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionadded:: 1.3.0

Activates :ref:`runtime_debugging`, which measures the execution time of different functions and creates a helpful
JSON and HTML report.

See :ref:`runtime_debugging` for details.

To activate it, set it to ``True``::

   needs_debug_measurement = True


Removed options
---------------

The following options are no longer supported in the latest versions of **Sphinx-Needs**.

.. _needs_template:

needs_template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*removed: 0.3.0*

The layout of needs can be fully customized by using `jinja <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__.

If nothing is set, the following default template is used:

.. code-block:: jinja

   {% raw -%}

   .. _{{id}}:

   {% if hide == false -%}
   .. role:: needs_tag
   .. role:: needs_status
   .. role:: needs_type
   .. role:: needs_id
   .. role:: needs_title

   .. rst-class:: need
   .. rst-class:: need_{{type_name}}

   .. dropdown::
      :class: need

       :needs_type:`{{type_name}}`: :needs_title:`{{title}}` :needs_id:`{{id}}`
           {%- if status and  status|upper != "NONE" and not hide_status %}
           | status: :needs_status:`{{status}}`
           {%- endif -%}
           {%- if tags and not hide_tags %}
           | tags: :needs_tag:`{{tags|join("` :needs_tag:`")}}`
           {%- endif %}
           | links incoming: :need_incoming:`{{id}}`
           | links outgoing: :need_outgoing:`{{id}}`

           {{content|indent(8) }}

   {% endif -%}

   {% endraw %}

Available jinja variables are:

* type
* type_name
* type_prefix
* status
* tags
* id
* links
* title
* content
* hide


.. warning::

   You must add a reference like `.. _{{ '{{id}}' }}:` to the template. Otherwise linking will not work!

.. _needs_template_collapse:

needs_template_collapse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*removed: 0.3.0*

Defines a template used for a need with active option **collapse**.

Default value:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% raw -%}

    .. _{{id}}:

    {% if hide == false -%}
   .. role:: needs_tag
   .. role:: needs_status
   .. role:: needs_type
   .. role:: needs_id
   .. role:: needs_title
   .. rst-class:: need
   .. rst-class:: need_{{type_name}}

   .. dropdown::
      :class: need

               :needs_type:`{{type_name}}`: :needs_title:`{{title}}` :needs_id:`{{id}}`
               :needs_type:`{{type_name}}`: :needs_title:`{{title}}` :needs_id:`{{id}}`
           {%- if status and  status|upper != "NONE" and not hide_status %}
           | status: :needs_status:`{{status}}`
           {%- endif -%}
           {%- if tags and not hide_tags %}
           | tags: :needs_tag:`{{tags|join("` :needs_tag:`")}}`
           {%- endif %}
           | links incoming: :need_incoming:`{{id}}`
           | links outgoing: :need_outgoing:`{{id}}`

       {{content|indent(4) }}

   {% endif -%}
   {% endraw %}

For more details please see :ref:`needs_template`.

.. _needs_hide_options:

needs_hide_options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.3.0

*removed: 0.5.0*

.. note::

   To remove options from output in **Sphinx-Needs** version >= ``0.5.0`` you must provide your own layout, which
   does not include these options. See :ref:``layouts_styles`` for more information.

Can be used to hide specific options from general output in rendered document::

   needs_hide_options = ['tags', 'global_option']

Works with local set options, extra options and global options.

Default value: ``['hidden']``

The ``hidden`` option is a globally available option, which is always hidden and
can be used to easily execute :ref:`dynamic_functions`.

Combined with :ref:`dynamic_functions` and :ref:`needs_global_options` this configuration can be used to perform
complex calculations in the background and hide any output.

.. _needs_collapse_details:

needs_collapse_details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0

*removed: 0.5.0*

.. note::

   Starting with version 0.5.0 the used :ref:`layout <layouts>` decides what the default behavior is.
   To customize this behavior, you have to create your own :ref:`layout <layouts>`.

If true, need options like status, tags or links are collapsed and shown only after a click on the arrow close to the need title.

.. code-block:: python

    # conf.py
    needs_collapse_details = False

Default value: True

Can be overwritten for each single need by setting :ref:`need_collapse`.
