Builders
========

.. _needs_builder:

needs
-----
.. versionadded:: 0.1.30

The **needs** builder exports all found needs and selected filter results to a single json file.

The build creates a folder called **needs** and a file called **needs.json** inside the given build-folder.

Usage
+++++

.. code-block:: bash

    sphinx-build -b needs source_dir build_dir


.. hint::

   As an alternative, you can set the :ref:`needs_build_json` parameter in **conf.py** to create a ``needs.json`` file directly during the build
   of another output format like ``html``.

History data
++++++++++++

The builder stores the needs under a version taken from your **conf.py**.

If a **needs.json** is imported (see :ref:`needs_file`) and you raise the documentation version, the new version is stored beside the old
version(s) inside the **needs.json**.

.. hint::
   If you generate and store/archive (e.g. in git) the **needs.json** file
   every time you raise your documentation version, you will get a nice history data.

.. _filter_export:

Exporting filters
+++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 0.3.11

The results and filter configuration of a filter based directive, like :ref:`needlist`, :ref:`needtable`
or :ref:`needflow` gets exported, if the option :ref:`export_id` is used in the related directive.

This allows to export specified filter results only.


|ex|:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. needtable::
      :status: open
      :filter: "test" in tags
      :export_id: filter_01


Format

.. _needumls_builder:

needumls
--------

The **needumls** builder saves each :ref:`needuml` generated plantuml code to a file, and stores all the files into a single folder during the build.
The file is created only if the option ``:save:`` from :ref:`needuml` is configured.

The build creates a folder called **needumls** inside the given build-folder, e.g. `_build/needumls`.

Usage
+++++

.. code-block:: bash

    make needumls

or

.. code-block:: bash

    sphinx-build -M needumls source_dir build_dir

.. hint::

    As an alternative, you can set the config option :ref:`needs_build_needumls` to export the needumls files during each build.
